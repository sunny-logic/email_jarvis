# email_jarvis
A simple setup to issue predefined commands to Raspberry Pi from Email (Gmail).
This helps you get around the process of installing VPN and the hassles around it like port-forwarding, Static IP, Etc.
Although, I have OpenVPN installed and running on my Raspberry Pi 2 and used in this project to restart using OpenVPN using email.

I have created this during my spare leisure time as a hobby to (re)indulge myself into the wonderful world of programming.
There may be issues/improvements needed for this project which I will try to address as and when possible.
Appreciations/Suggestions/ideas are welcome.
